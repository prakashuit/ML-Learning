#### 1) Intelligence and World Models
- Intelligence: forming simplified “models of the world” so we can predict what happens next.
- A model is anything that lets you make predictions. Example: “Dark clouds → it’s going to rain.”


#### 2) Three Ways Computers Learn
- AI is the umbrella. Within AI:
  - Machine Learning (ML): learn patterns from data.
  - Deep Learning (DL): ML with neural networks that learn features automatically.
  - Reinforcement Learning (RL): learn by interacting with an environment via rewards.

#### 3) Machine Learning (ML)

##### 3.1 Training vs Inference
- Training: Fit model parameters using labeled examples to minimize error.
- Inference: Use the trained model to make predictions on new inputs.

##### 3.2 Fitting Predictions to Reality (Loss Minimization)
- Example: Linear regression predicts a value (e.g., tomorrow’s temperature) from inputs (e.g., today’s temperature).

Key formulas:

\[\hat{y} = mx + b\]

\[\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2\]

- Training = choose parameters m (slope) and b (intercept) that minimize the loss.

##### 3.3 Traditional ML Techniques and Feature Engineering
- Common models:
  - Logistic Regression: binary classification with probabilistic outputs.
  - Decision Trees: if-then splits on features.
  - Random Forest: many trees averaged for robustness.
  - XGBoost: boosted trees, strong tabular performance.
  - SVM: find a maximum-margin separating boundary.
- Limitation: Often requires feature engineering (domain expertise to craft useful inputs).


#### 4) Deep Learning (DL)

##### 4.1 Why Deep Learning?
- Neural networks learn “useful features” directly from raw data (images, audio, text), reducing manual feature engineering.
- Example pipeline: raw pixels → edges → parts → concepts → “cat” prediction.

##### 4.2 Neurons, Layers, Networks
- A neuron does: weighted sum + bias → non-linear activation.

\[ z = g\!\left(\sum_i w_i x_i + b\right) \]

- Layers stack neurons; networks stack layers.
- Components “zoo”:
  - Activations: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, Softmax.
  - Layers: Fully Connected, Convolutional, Recurrent, Attention, Pooling, Normalization, Dropout.
  - Architectures: Feedforward, CNN, RNN/LSTM, Transformer.

##### 4.3 Training NNs; Loss Landscapes
- Neural networks have complex, non-convex loss surfaces (many hills/valleys). Goal is to find low-loss regions.

##### 4.4 Gradient Descent and Optimizers
- Gradient Descent update:

\[ \theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \gamma \, \nabla_\theta \, \mathcal{L}(\theta_t) \]

  - \(\gamma\) is the learning rate (step size).
- Practical optimizers:
  - GD: uses all data per step (stable, slow).
  - SGD: one sample per step (noisy, can escape local minima).
  - Mini-batch SGD: small batch per step (common default).
  - Adam: adaptive learning rates with momentum-like terms.

##### 4.5 Hyperparameters
- Epochs: passes over the dataset.
- Learning rate: step size in parameter space.
- Batch size: samples per update.
- Dropout: randomly dropping neurons during training to reduce overfitting.


#### 5) Reinforcement Learning (RL)

##### 5.1 Learning by Trial-and-Error
- RL agent interacts with an environment: takes action \(a_t\); receives next state \(s_{t+1}\) and reward \(r_{t+1}\).
- Goal: learn a policy that maximizes cumulative reward.

##### 5.2 The Promise
- Not limited by human labels—can exceed human expertise via self-play/exploration (AlphaGo example).

##### 5.3 Objective and Policy Gradient Intuition
- Objective (maximize expected return):

\[ J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi_\theta} \Big[ \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} r_{t+1} \Big] \]

- Policy gradient (intuition):

\[ \nabla_\theta J(\theta) \approx \mathbb{E} \big[ \, \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a_t\mid s_t) \cdot G_t \, \big] \]

- Gradient ascent (maximize):

\[ \theta_{t+1} = \theta_t + \gamma \, \nabla_\theta J(\theta_t) \]

##### 5.4 More RL Techniques
- REINFORCE: basic policy gradient.
- TRPO: constrains policy updates (trust region).
- PPO: stable updates via clipped objective (popular).
- GRPO: group-relative policy optimization variant (stability/efficiency improvements).


#### 6) Data Is Paramount
- Quantity: more data generally improves generalization.
- Quality: accuracy, diversity, and representativeness matter.
- Principle: “Garbage in, garbage out.”

#### 7) Key Takeaways
- Build accurate world models to solve problems.
- ML fits models to reality with data + math (train vs infer).
- DL uses neural networks to learn features from raw data.
- RL learns by interacting and maximizing rewards—can surpass human strategies.
- Data quality and quantity are the ultimate drivers of model performance.
